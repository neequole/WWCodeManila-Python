## Dictionaries

Imagine that we will create a simple PostalPH bot that allows a user to ask his/her postal code giving the bot his/her area.


```
PostalPHBot: Hello! What is your area?
Goblin: binondo
PostalPHBot: Hi! Your postal area is 1006.
```

How will you store the ff. mapping in Python?

```
Binondo: 1006
Intramuros: 1002
Malate: 1004
Ermita: 1000
Paco: 1007
Inagi-shi: 13225
Hino-shi: 13212
and many more...
```

Hmmm.... with a loooong conditional statements like this?

```python
area = input('Hello! What is your area?').lower()

if area == 'binondo':
    print('Hi! Your postal area is 1006.')
elif area == 'intramuros':
    print('Hi! Your postal area is 1004.')
# and a lot more if-else!

```

#### Creation and Value Access

Good thing, Python allows us to store collections for mapping or associating a `key` with a `value`, just like how a dictionary allows us to search for a word(the key) and its meaning(the value)!
Python dictionaries are collections just like lists but instead of having numbers as its index, we can use strings, numbers or tuples instead. Let's try to use dictionary to our postal bot!

```python
postal_mapping = {
    'binondo': 1006,
    'intramuros': 1002,
    'malate': 1004,
    'ermita': 1000,
    'paco': 1007,
    'inagi-shi': 13225,
    'hino-shi': 13212
}

area = input('Hello! What is your area?').lower()

if area in postal_mapping:
    print('Hi! Your postal area is {}'.format(postal_mapping[area]))
else:
    print('Sorry! The area you provided was not found on our records.')

```

We created a dictionary by enclosing in braces(`{}`) the key-value pairs which are separated by colon(`:`).

See how we accessed the dictionary value? We used strings(the area) as the dictionary key and used that `key` to retrieve the postal value.
```
your_dictionary[key]
```

Why did we check first if the area is in our dictionary? See what will happen if we have the code below and we input 'makati' to our postal bot.

```python
postal_mapping = {
    'binondo': 1006,
    'intramuros': 1002,
    'malate': 1004,
    'ermita': 1000,
    'paco': 1007,
    'inagi-shi': 13225,
    'hino-shi': 13212
}

area = input('Hello! What is your area?').lower()
# We removed the checking. YOLO!
print('Hi! Your postal area is {}'.format(postal_mapping[area]))
```

#### Dictionary update and methods

Postal Bot update! Let's add Quaipo to our dictionary and also, remove the odd Inagi-shi and Hino-shi as we found out it was for PostJP bot not PostPH bot!

```python
postal_mapping = {
    'binondo': 1006,
    'intramuros': 1002,
    'malate': 1004,
    'ermita': 1000,
    'paco': 1007,
    'inagi-shi': 13225,
    'hino-shi': 13212
}

# Let's add Quiapo
postal_mapping['quaipo'] = 1001

# Let's delete Inagi-shi
del postal_mapping['inagi-shi']

# Dictionaries have methods too!
# Let's delete Hino-shi using the pop method
deleted_value = postal_mapping.pop('hino-shi')
print('Removed {} from mapping'.format(deleted_value))

# Dictionaries have functions too!
# Let's print its length using the len function
print('We now have a total of {} postal mapping'.format(len(postal_mapping)))
```

### Challenge
Good job! You are nearly complete in knowing some basic programming concepts using Python! Let's get our fingers and mind working!

Just like in grocery stores where items where scanned one by one and the
total amount due is summed, please help Aling Nena's Sari-sari store
to compute a customer's total order amount and print the receipt by:
* Input the customer's products
* The product dictionary contains Aling Nena's products and maps it's price.
* If the product name is NOT in her list, just print 'Item <product name> void!'
  and skip it from the computation of total amount due.
* If the product is in the list, please print current purchased products and
  their quantity.
* If done punching the items:
    - Print each purchased products, it's quantity, price, total price (quantity * price)
    - Print the total items and total amount due.

Example:
```shell
>> Item name:  sunsilk
{'sunsilk': 1}
>> Are you done? Press y to finish: n
>> Item name:  SUNsilk
{'sunsilk': 2}
>> Are you done? Press y to finish: n
>> Item name:  ligo
{'sunsilk': 2, 'ligo': 1}
>> Are you done? Press y to finish: n
>> Item name:  Spam
{'sunsilk': 2, 'ligo': 1, 'spam': 1}
>> Are you done? Press y to finish: n
>> Item name:  test
Item test void!
>> Are you done? Press y to finish: n
>> Item name:  ligo
{'sunsilk': 2, 'ligo': 2, 'spam': 1}
>> Are you done? Press y to finish: y
***** PRINTING YOUR RECEIPT *****
sunsilk 7.5 * 2 = 15.0
ligo 12.0 * 2 = 24.0
spam 115.25 * 1 = 115.25
5 items --------- 154.25
```

Just some notes:
* Please use and copy [dictionaries01.py](https://github.com/wwcodemanila/WWCodeManila-Python/blob/master/exercises/dictionaries/dictionaries01.py) as template.

```
Gitlab project -> exercises -> dictionaries
```

* Please rename the file as `<first name initial><middle name initial><last name>_dictionaries01.py`. For example, John M. Doe will name his file as `jmdoe_dictionaries01.py`.
* Share your work and contribute to the community! Complete how-to share your work instruction [here](https://github.com/wwcodemanila/WWCodeManila-Python/blob/master/exercise_upload_step.md).
  * Create a Github account if none yet and create a repository for wwcode-python. You will upload your works there.
  * Please upload or push the file in your GIT repository.
  * Open an issue in our repository named `<Your name> - <topic>`. For example, `John Doe - Loops`.
  * Share the link of your work on the issue.
* Present your work in front (#ApplaudHer)! You can also share your study group experience in social media and tag us!
* Enjoy!


## Put your thinking cap on!

- Is there a way to avoid a KeyError when using `pop()` to an non-existent key?
- What are the allowed keys of a dictionary? What attribute do they share in common?
- How do you check if a certain key exists in a dictionary?
- How do you loop through a dictionary, getting both it's key and value pair?

And add more!
