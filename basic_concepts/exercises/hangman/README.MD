# Hang on mate!

As a Python coding ninja, you already are equipped with the following skills:
- [X] Variables, Arithmetic Operations, Keyboard Input
- [X] Coding conventions of PEP8
- [X] Strings
- [X] Lists
- [X] Conditional Statements
- [X] Loops

To polish these more, aside from hanging out with us(lol), we are challenging you to do the never aging `Hangman` game!

## Getting Started

This exercise is from Michael Dawson's "Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner 3rd Edition".
We have given a template file to help you implement the game step-by-step but you could do your own from scratch
if that's easier for you.

Hang in there and let the game begin!

### Resources

You can use the template file here for this exercise.

* To run:

```python

```
