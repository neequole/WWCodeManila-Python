## Let's do some warm up

Now we will run a very basic Python program that will print `Hello WomenWhoCode!`. This will allow you to run a basic Python program:

- [ ] from the terminal
- [ ] from your editor


### Copy sample file

Please copy/download the [first_python_code.py](https://github.com/wwcodemanila/WWCodeManila-Python/blob/master/samples/first_python_code.py) file under `samples` folder.

```
Git project -> samples -> first_python_code.py
```


### Running your first Python program

Let's try to run some Python code!

#### Using a terminal

- Open a terminal

```
Windows: Click Start -> Type cmd
Mac: Open Applications folder -> Utilities folder
```
- Go to the directory of the file by running the following command. If you need help finding the directory path, you can ask the mentor how.

```
cd <path to your copy of first_python_code>
```

- Run our `first_python_code.py` by typing the following command.
 
```
python first_python_code.py
```

or

```
python3 first_python_code.py
```

- This is your simple program that prints some text. The output should be

```
Hello WomenWhoCode!
Hello WomanWhoCode!
Hello WomenWhoCode!
```

#### Using an editor

Open the file using your text editor and run the code! You should see the same result.

### Try printing your name
- Open the file using your text editor.
- Inside the file, there is an instruction. Follow it! :)
- When you are done, save the file and run it again in your terminal and editor!

```
Hello WomenWhoCode!
Hello WomanWhoCode!
Hello WomenWhoCode!
Nicole loves Python!
```

Now you have run your first program!

## Put your thinking cap on!

- What is the extension of a Python file?
- What do you call the `cd`? What does it do?
- What does the `print()` do?
- What does the `.format()` do?
- What is the magic of the `#` symbol?

And add more!
