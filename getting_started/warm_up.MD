## Let's do some warm up

Now we will run a very basic Python program that will print `Hello WomenWhoCode!`. This will allow you to run a basic Python program:

- [ ] from the terminal
- [ ] from your editor


### Copy sample file

Please copy the sample file below and save as `first_python_code.py`.

```python
# Basic example on how to print
# text using different approach in
# Python.

organization = 'WomenWhoCode!'

# You can print it right away!
print('Hello WomanWhoCode!')

# Example of string concatenation
print('Hello ' + organization)

# Using .format() function to attach a string
print('Hello {}'.format(organization))
# print(f'Hello {organization}')  # Can use this format with Python3.6

# First, replace the following text with your name
your_name = '<place your name here>'

# Then, uncomment the next line by removing the "#" sign
#print('{} loves Python!'.format(your_name))
```


### Run your first Python program

Let's try to run some Python code!


#### Using a terminal

- Open a terminal

```
Windows: Click Start -> Type cmd
Mac: Open Applications folder -> Utilities folder
```
- Go to the directory of the file by running the following command. If you need help finding the directory path, you can ask the mentor how.

```
cd <path to your copy of first_python_code>
```

- Run our `first_python_code.py` by typing the following command.
 
```
python first_python_code.py
```

or

```
python3 first_python_code.py
```

- This is your simple program that prints some text. The output should be

```
Hello WomenWhoCode!
Hello WomanWhoCode!
Hello WomenWhoCode!
```


#### Using an editor

Open the file using your text editor and run the code! You should see the same result.

### Try printing your name
- Open the file using your text editor.
- Inside the file, there is an instruction. Follow it! :)
- When you are done, save the file and run it again in your terminal and editor!

```
Hello WomenWhoCode!
Hello WomanWhoCode!
Hello WomenWhoCode!
Nicole loves Python!
```

Now you have run your first program!

## Put your thinking cap on!

- What is the extension of a Python file?
- What do you call the `cd`? What does it do?
- What does the `print()` do?
- What does the `.format()` do?
- What is the magic of the `#` symbol?

And add more!
